==============

This is my resume written in LaTeX. [Look at it!](https://github.com/claytonketner/general-resume/blob/master/output/Clayton-Ketner_General-Resume.pdf)

Yes, it's overkill. Yes, it's awesome.

How To
------------
- Make changes to `.tex` files
- Run `./build.sh`, which builds the PDF using `pdftex` and then opens it in the Preview app
(Note: `build.sh` assumes you're using OSX, because it uses the Preview app)
