        \item Project/tech lead:
        \begin{itemize}%
            \item Team lead for a project involving redesigning an existing robotics workcell to improve sample volume capacity, user interaction, and reliability
            \item Also acted as the technical lead for other subteams of the project, providing expertise on automation equipment and processes
            \item Cross-functionally gathered requirements, led design reviews, and managed equipment and system validation across the CLIA lab staff, equipment service team, and development scientists
            \item Assessed what work was required, generated and maintained a timeline, and tracked and distributed work amongst myself and others
            \item Successfully completed the project ahead of schedule and without issues
        \end{itemize}%
        \item Software engineer:
        \begin{itemize}%
            \item Took on app and instrument driver work from the software team when necessary
            \item General scripting with Python
        \end{itemize}%
        \item Designed and documented mechanical and electrical assemblies for contract manufacturing
        \item Performed troubleshooting on complex systems involving hardware, electronics, and software issues to identify root cause and provide fixes
        \item Utilized machine shop skills to create one-off fixtures and parts as needed
    \end{itemize}
